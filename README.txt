# All-in-One Utility Application

## Project Overview
This project is a menu-driven, console-based utility application that includes multiple tools to perform various tasks covered in class exercises. The application features a hierarchical menu system that allows smooth navigation and interaction between different utilities without restarting the program.

## Features and Functionalities
1. Input Validation and Error Handling
   - Ensures robust error handling and user-friendly interactions across all utilities.
   
2. Seamless Navigation
   - Users can switch between different tools and repeat actions without restarting the program.
   
3. Included Applications:
   1. Palindrome String Generator and Checker
      - Accepts a string input from the user.
      - Checks if it is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).
      - Generates a palindrome by reversing the input string.
      
   2. Arithmetic Calculator
      - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
      - Uses pointers to dynamically allocate memory for operations.
      
   3. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
      - Allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
      - Provides an option to enter a custom key value for encryption.
      
   4. Checkers Game
      - Implements a simple text-based checkers game for two players.
      - Provides valid move suggestions and tracks the game state.
      
   5. Password Generator and Strength Checker
      - Generates secure passwords based on user-selected criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
      - Evaluates and displays password strength based on complexity.
      
   6. Typing Speed and Accuracy Tester
      - Allows users to type a given text and measures their speed (words per minute).
      - Provides an accuracy percentage based on typing errors.
      
   7. Age Calculator
      - Accepts the user's birth date and calculates age in:
        - Years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
        
   8. Unit Converter
      - Converts values for:
        - Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
        - Mass (Kilograms, Pounds, Grams).
        - Length (Meters, Kilometers, Miles, Inches).
        
   9. Number Guessing Game
      - Generates a random number within a given range.
      - Provides hints (higher/lower) and counts the number of attempts taken.
